# Exercise: Squat Arm Abduction

!> Status: Draft

The question of selecting the movement is based on if itâ€™s suitable to evaluate the range of functionality of the proposed system. The evaluation the pose evaluation needs to be as objective as possible - which is actually not that easy. But there are some globally accepted rules that are getting applied accordingly to the exercise.

For my master thesis, I want to evaluate a full body movement during a fitness activity which includes weight / muscle activation exercises. Thus, the exercise I need has to cover the main body joint areas:
- shoulder, 
- back, 
- abdomen, 
- hip, 
- knee and 
- ankle. 

Exercises for these are usually squats and arm abduction movements.
My movement is therefore a squat with lateral arm abductions which you can see in the attached image.

The ruleset for this movement is summarized as the following:
Frontal aspects
- Head vertically in line
- Arm elevation symmetrical into horizontal line
- Elbow straight
- Wrist straight and in line with elbow
- Kneecap always in line with the feet, also during movement (preventing X/O legs)
- Feet slightly rotated outwards (depending on how wide the feet are, based on the hip bone)

Sagital aspects
- Neck slightly bend (natural 20 degree bending)
- Backbone straight
- Hip rotated up to max 100 degree
- Knee joint rotated to 90 degree
