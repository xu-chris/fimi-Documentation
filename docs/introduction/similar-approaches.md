### Apps

All apps are mainly available for the iOS platform since iOS already includes a pose estimation algorithm. According to App Store reviews, all apps have problems with app stability.

Most of the apps are probably using the [Fittonic iOS SDK](http://fittonic.app) built by [Synesis](https://synesis.partners/) which provides a pre-trained model for a price of 500$ / month + 100$ for more than 1.000 devices for each 1.000th device.
